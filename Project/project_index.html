      <h1>The Economics of Survival in Men’s Professional Tennis (2000–2025)</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        This project explores how prize money in men’s professional tennis is distributed across players, 
        and asks a simple question with complex implications: <strong>how many players can actually 
        afford to live from tennis?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining ATP prize money data (2000–2025) with cost estimates from the academic literature, 
        the visualisations below quantify income inequality in the men’s circuit and approximate the 
        ranking region at which players reach <em>financial break-even</em>.

         SECTION 1 – CONTEXT & METHOD
    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>1. Economic motivation and methods</h2>
      <p>
        Many competitive markets follow a <strong>winner-takes-most</strong> structure: a small group of top performers captures
        a disproportionate share of total earnings, while most participants receive modest returns. Men’s professional tennis 
        behaves in a similar way. Although first-round losers receive prize money, the amounts are small relative to the 
        financial burden of sustaining a full season on tour.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis in this project is inspired by recent work estimating the <em>annual operational costs</em> of a professional 
        tennis career and the ranking at which players reach financial break-even. Costs include travel, coaching, 
        accommodation, equipment and stringing, and are benchmarked in the literature at roughly 
        <strong>$53,000–$105,000 per year</strong> (in contemporary dollars). For simplicity and transparency, the project uses the 
        lower-bound estimate as a conservative annual cost benchmark and expresses both costs and prize money in 
        constant US dollars.
      </p>

    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>2. How unequal is prize money in men’s tennis?</h2>

      <p>
        The first pair of charts visualises the overall distribution of prize money among male players. The Lorenz curve 
        presents how cumulative earnings accumulate across players ranked from lowest to highest prize money, while the 
        Gini coefficient summarises that inequality into a single number per year.
      </p>

    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>3. Where is the financial “survival line”?</h2>

      <p>
        The next set of visualisations links prize money to ranking position and to the estimated cost of maintaining
        a professional career. The key idea is to approximate the ranking region where prize money alone is sufficient 
        to cover annual operational costs.
      </p>

      <h3>Chart 3. Prize money by ranking band (men)</h3>
      <p class="chart-note">
        Prize money is grouped into ranking bands (e.g. 1–10, 11–50, 51–100, 101–150, 151–300, 301–500) and expressed in
        constant dollars.

        Finally, the project examines whether rising prize money has translated into improved financial sustainability for 
        a broader group of players, once inflation is taken into account. The last chart tracks real prize money at key ranking 
        positions across time.

        The lines track constant-dollar earnings for reference rankings (e.g. 10, 50, 100, 150, 250), allowing comparison
        with the cost benchmark.

        <ul>
          <li>Only a small fraction of male players earning ATP prize money appear to reach financial break-even.</li>
          <li>The structure of prize money reinforces a winner-takes-most distribution, concentrating earnings in the very top.</li>
          <li>Redistribution at early rounds, support for Challenger/ITF players, or targeted subsidies could improve financial sustainability without fundamentally changing the tournament model.</li>
