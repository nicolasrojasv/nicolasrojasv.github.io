      <h2>1. Aims</h2>
      <p>
        This project examines the distribution of prize money in men’s professional tennis and assesses 
        how many players can realistically afford to make a living from the sport. To do so, it combines
        a <a href="https://github.com/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/Project/data/players_activity.csv">
        newly constructed panel dataset of ATP prize money</a> with inflation-adjusted cost estimates from

         SECTION 1 – MOTIVATION: PRIZE MONEY INEQUALITY
    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>2. Tennis is a very unequal sport</h2>

      <p>
        Tennis is the 
        <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-sport/analysis.htm">
        fifth most-watched sport worldwide</a>, after Football, Basketball, Cricket, and Baseball, which
        allows it to rank as the 
        <a href="https://www.spond.com/news-and-blog/top-10-richest-sports-in-the-world/">
        eighth highest-revenue-generating sport annually</a>. Despite this, the distribution of income 
        among players is by far the 
        <a href="https://econreview.studentorg.berkeley.edu/the-biggest-unforced-error-in-sports-tennis-inequality-problem-explained/">
        most unequal</a> when considering the top 30 earners, compared with Ice Hockey, American Football,
        Basketball, and Baseball.
      </p>

       <p>
        When considering all ranked players, the Gini coefficient of men’s professional tennis reaches 
        0.924 in 2025, indicating an extremely high level of income inequality, close to the upper bound 
        of the index. To put this magnitude into perspective, the first chart compares professional tennis 
        with countries that are among the most unequal and among the most equal income distributions 
        observed internationally in the same year, such as Colombia and Norway, respectively. 
        The comparison highlights that income inequality in professional tennis is substantially higher
        than that observed even in highly unequal countries' income distributions.

      <p>
        To produce the previous chart, data on player activity were extracted using a 
        <a href="https://github.com/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/Project/scripts/scrape_price_money_atp_players.ipynb">
        Python script</a> for all ATP-ranked players active between the 2014 and 2025 seasons. One of the
        main challenges was identifying how to access the data directly from the underlying API endpoints
        used by the ATP website, as the site does not otherwise allow straightforward data extraction. 
        To enable a comparison with national income inequality, data on the Gini coefficient were 
        retrieved from the World Bank API, which provides country-level time series for this indicator.
      </p>

      <p>
        When selecting different years, there is little variation in the ATP Tour’s Gini coefficient.
        This is more clearly illustrated in the time-series chart, which shows that when all ranked
        players are considered, inequality in ATP prize money has remained relatively stable over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interacting with this chart reveals two insights that motivate an analysis of the financial
        break-even point between prize money and the costs of a professional career. First, only when
        the analysis is restricted to the top 200 players does the ATP Tour’s Gini coefficient reach 
        levels comparable to Colombia’s, while for the top 50 players, inequality among tennis players
        is lower than in the United States. Second, the slope of the ATP Tour Gini time series becomes
        more negative when focusing on the top 300 players. That is, between 2014 and 2025, inequality 
        within this group has declined, which may indicate that a larger share of players are reaching 
        their financial break-even point.

         SECTION 2 – FINANCIAL BREAK EVEN POINT
    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>2. Are more players achieving financial equilibrium?</h2>

      <p>
        Balliauw et al. (2017) estimates that in 2015 the average annual cost of competing on the professional 
        tennis circuit was €76,073, which corresponds to USD 82,821, based on the exchange rate as of 31
        December 2015, according to the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/eurofxref-graph-usd.en.html">
        European Central Bank</a>. Because prize money is reported in nominal dollars for each year, 
        the average annual cost was adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as 
        of December of each year, obtained from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">
        the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before answering the question, let us look at the distribution of prize money to better understand
        the data. Because prize money is heavily concentrated at low values, a density plot obscures the
        financial break-even point. An interactive line chart is therefore used to make visible
        the threshold at which players begin to finance their professional careers through prize money.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2025, professional tennis becomes financially sustainable from the world No. 274 onward,
        with a positive balance of just USD 319. In other words, only 274 players out of more 
        than 2,000 professional tennis players were able to fully finance their season through prize money
        earned in tournaments. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared with 2014, the break-even threshold has shifted downward: more than 80 additional players
        are now able to cover the annual cost of competing on the professional circuit. This change 
        suggests a modest but meaningful improvement in the financial sustainability of professional 
        tennis over the past decade.

      <p>
        The next time series chart shows a gradual improvement in the share of professional tennis 
        players who are able to fully finance their season through prize money: in 2014, only about 7% of 
        players reached the financial break-even point, increasing by 3.7 percentage points over a decade
        to reach 10.7% in 2025. Overall, the trend suggests a modest but meaningful expansion in the
        group of players reaching break-even, consistent with the downward shift in the break-even ranking
        observed in earlier figures; however, the limited magnitude of this change indicates that
        structural constraints in the professional tennis income model persist.

         SECTION 3 – THE POWER OF PRICE MONEY ON LONGEVITY
    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>3. The Predictor Power of Prize Money on Longevity</h2>

      <p>
        Motivated by the fact that only a small fraction of professional tennis players are able to fully
        finance their careers through prize money, this analysis examines whether cumulative prize 
        earnings can predict career duration among retired players. The hypothesis is that players who
        accumulate higher total prize money over their careers tend to remain longer on the professional
        circuit, implying a positive relationship between cumulative earnings and years on tour.
      </p>

      <p>
        To construct the dataset used for prediction, a panel of ATP players’ prize money was compiled, 
        adjusted all monetary values to constant 2025 USD, using the FRED API, and identified players 
        no longer active in 2025 as retired. The sample was restricted to players who accumulated no more 
        than USD 10 million over their careers, as the analysis focuses on players closer to the financial
        threshold required to cover the total cost of a professional season, rather than on top earners 
        whose careers are trivially sustainable. A Random Forest regression model was estimated using
        scikit-learn, with performance evaluated on a test set using R² and RMSE.
      </p>

      <p>
        The figure shows a clear positive relationship between predicted and actual career length. 
        Although the R² is relatively high, it is important to note that the model exhibits substantial
        dispersion when predicting shorter careers, frequently overestimating or underestimating career
        length by as much as a factor of two. This pattern indicates that cumulative earnings alone do not
        fully determine career longevity, pointing to the relevance of additional factors, such as injuries,
        sponsorships or access to institutional support, in shaping professional tennis careers.

      <h2>4. Conclusion and Discusion</h2>

      <p>
        This project highlights the extremely high levels of income inequality in men’s professional 
        tennis and the very small proportion of players who are able to finance the cost of a full 
        competitive season through prize money, reinforcing recent findings in the literature on ATP 
        Tour financing (Balliauw et al., 2017; Schoettl et al., 2025). Its main contribution is the
        integration of a temporal perspective, which allows the evolution of the financial break-even
        point to be analysed over time. The newly constructed panel dataset and publicly available code
        enable regular updates and extensions of the analysis, encouraging further research on policies 
        aimed at improving the financial sustainability of professional tennis careers. 
        A remaining challenge is that annual costs were adjusted for inflation, while actual costs may
        have risen faster, potentially leading to an overestimation of the share of players reaching 
        break-even. An issue that future work could address by automating and updating cost estimates.
