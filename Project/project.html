      <h1>The Economics of Survival in Men’s Professional Tennis</h1>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

      <h3>1.1. Aims</h3>
      <p>
        This project examines the distribution of prize money in men’s professional tennis and assesses 
        how many players can realistically afford to make a living from the sport. To do so, it combines
        a <a href="https://github.com/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/Project/data/players_activity.csv">
        newly constructed panel dataset of ATP prize money</a> with inflation-adjusted cost estimates from 
        <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10067/1429110151162165141">Balliauw et al. (2017)</a>,
        quantifying income inequality in the men’s circuit and approximating the ranking threshold at 
        which players achieve financial break-even

      </p>

      <h3>1.2. Building an ATP Prize Money Panel Dataset </h3>

      <p>
        This project contributes a new panel 
        <a href="https://github.com/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/Project/data/players_activity.csv">
        dataset</a> covering all ATP-ranked players active between the 2014 and 2025 
        seasons. The dataset records prize money earned across all tournaments, and the
        <a href="https://github.com/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/scrape_price_money_atp_players.ipynb">
        code</a> is designed to be easily extended to earlier players or future seasons by
        expanding the date range. A key challenge was accessing the ATP website’s 
        underlying API endpoints, as the platform does not allow straightforward data
        extraction using standard Python scraping libraries. An unresolved challenge is 
        finding a way to iterate over a longer time span, as the website blocks access
        after extracting data for approximately eleven years. In addition to this dataset,
        a separate file containing 
        <a href="https://github.com/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/Project/data/players_characteristics.csv">
        ATP player characteristics</a> was constructed using this
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/nicolasrojasv/nicolasrojasv.github.io/blob/main/scrape_atp_players_overview.ipynb">
        code</a>. To enable comparisons with country-level income inequality, Gini coefficient 
        data were retrieved from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI">
        World Bank API</a>. Inflation adjustments were performed 
        using data from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/">
        Federal Reserve Bank API</a>, which requires user authentication 
        and an access key, while exchange rate data were obtained from the 
        <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/eurofxref-graph-usd.en.html">
        European Central Bank</a>.

         SECTION 1 – MOTIVATION: PRIZE MONEY INEQUALITY
    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>2. Tennis is a very unequal sport</h2>

      <p>
        Tennis is the 
        <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-sport/analysis.htm">
        fifth most-watched sport worldwide</a>, after Football, Basketball, Cricket, and Baseball, which
        allows it to rank as the 
        <a href="https://www.spond.com/news-and-blog/top-10-richest-sports-in-the-world/">
        eighth highest-revenue-generating sport annually</a>. Despite this, the distribution of income 
        among players is by far the 
        <a href="https://econreview.studentorg.berkeley.edu/the-biggest-unforced-error-in-sports-tennis-inequality-problem-explained/">
        most unequal</a> when considering the top 30 earners, compared with Ice Hockey, American Football,
        Basketball, and Baseball.
      </p>

       <p>
        When considering all ranked players, the Gini coefficient of men’s professional tennis reaches 
        0.924 in 2025, indicating an extremely high level of income inequality, close to the upper bound 
        of the index. To put this magnitude into perspective, the first chart compares professional tennis 
        with countries that are among the most unequal and among the most equal income distributions 
        observed internationally in the same year, such as Colombia and Norway, respectively. 
        The comparison highlights that income inequality in professional tennis is substantially higher
        than that observed even in highly unequal countries' income distributions.

      <p>
        Across years, the ATP Tour’s Gini coefficient shows little variation when all 
        ranked players are considered, indicating relatively stable prize money inequality
        over time. However, the time-series chart below reveals two key insights that
        motivate an analysis of the financial break-even point: inequality reaches levels
        comparable to Colombia only when the sample is restricted to the top 200 players,
        while among the top 50 it is lower than in the United States; and when focusing on
        the top 300 players, the Gini trend becomes more negative between 2014 and 2025,
        suggesting a decline in inequality that may reflect a growing share of players 
        reaching their financial break-even point.

         SECTION 2 – FINANCIAL BREAK EVEN POINT
    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>2. Are more players achieving financial equilibrium?</h2>

      <p>
        To better understand the data, the distribution of prize money is examined first.
        Because prize money is highly concentrated at low values, a density plot obscures
        the financial break-even point; a line chart is therefore used to clearly identify
        the threshold at which players begin to finance their professional careers through
        prize money.

      <p>
        According to Balliauw et al. (2017), the average annual cost of competing on the
        professional tennis circuit is USD 113,494 in 2025, after adjusting for inflation 
        and exchange rates. Therefore, professional tennis becomes financially sustainable
        from world No. 274 onward, where this player achieves a marginally positive balance of 
        USD 319. In other words, only 274 out of more than 2,000 professional players fully
        finance their season through prize money. Compared with 2014, the break-even 
        threshold has shifted downward by more than 80 ranking positions, 
        indicating a modest but meaningful improvement in the financial sustainability of
        professional tennis over the past decade.

      <p>
        The next time-series chart shows a gradual improvement in the share of professional 
        tennis players able to fully finance their season through prize money: in 2014, about
        7% of players reached the financial break-even point, rising by 3.7 percentage points
        to 10.7% in 2025. Overall, the trend indicates a modest but meaningful expansion in 
        the group of players reaching break-even, consistent with the downward shift in the
        break-even ranking observed in earlier figures; however, the limited magnitude of this
        change suggests that structural constraints in the professional tennis income model 
        persist.

    ============================ -->
    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>3. The Predictor Power of Prize Money on Longevity</h2>

      <p>
        Motivated by the fact that only a small share of professional tennis players can 
        fully finance their careers through prize money, this analysis examines whether 
        cumulative prize earnings predict career duration among retired players.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using an inflation-adjusted panel of ATP prize money (constant 2025 USD), 
        retired players are defined as those inactive in 2025. An initial inspection of
        the data reveals two extreme outliers—Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Even after
        excluding them, a small group of players continues to accumulate prize money far
        above the rest. Accordingly, the analysis restricts the sample to players earning
        no more than USD 10 million, focusing on careers closer to the financial
        sustainability threshold.

      <p>
        A Random Forest regression model estimated in scikit-learn shows a positive 
        relationship between cumulative earnings and career length; however, despite a
        relatively high R², substantial dispersion, particularly for short careers, suggests
        that earnings alone do not determine longevity, highlighting the role of 
        additional factors such as injuries, sponsorships, and institutional support.

    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>4. Conclusion and Discusion</h2>

      <p>
        This project highlights the extreme income inequality in men’s professional tennis
        and the very small share of players able to finance a full competitive season 
        through prize money, reinforcing recent findings in the literature 
        (Balliauw et al., 2017; Schoettl et al., 2025). Its main contribution is the 
        introduction of a temporal perspective, allowing the evolution of the financial
        break-even point to be analysed over time. The newly constructed panel dataset 
        and publicly available code support regular updates and extensions, encouraging 
        further research on policies to improve the financial sustainability of 
        professional tennis careers. A remaining limitation is that annual costs were
        adjusted for inflation, while actual costs may have increased faster, potentially 
        overstating the share of players reaching break-even—an issue future work could 
        address by automating and updating cost estimates.
